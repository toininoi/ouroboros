"""Schema-layer tests for the v0.3 plugin manifest.

Third slice of #939. v0.3 tightens the JSON Schema enum for
``hooks[].name`` to the v1 ``HookKind`` set, so non-Python loaders get
a tighter guard than v0.2. v0.2 remains supported with its broader
enum for backward compatibility.

What this test file covers:

* 0.3 manifests with v1 hook names load via
  :func:`ouroboros.plugin.manifest.load_manifest`.
* 0.3 manifests that reference a deferred or excluded hook name fail
  with the schema-layer error pointer (``/hooks/0/name``).
* 0.2 manifests with deferred names still load, preserving the
  compatibility contract of the still-supported v0.2 schema.
