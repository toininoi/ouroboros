"""Task-class catalog for L1 of #1157.

`ooo auto` historically treated every goal as if it were a library with
unit-test acceptance. L1 of the Meta SSOT (#1157) introduces a *task
class* concept — a coarse classification of *what shape of artifact the
goal produces* — so the Seed Architect can inject class-appropriate
default acceptance criteria and the runtime evidence layer (L3) can
bind class-appropriate probes.

This module is **catalog data only** (L1-a sub-PR of #1171). It does
*not* implement domain inference from the ledger (L1-b), the Seed AC
injection hook (L1-c), or the result-envelope surface (L1-d).

Design constraints honored:

- **Plain strings, no LLM, no eval set.** The 7-class enum is frozen at
  this PR; growth happens via PR-per-class (~10 LoC + a unit test),
  not via re-curating a training corpus.
- **Decoupled from `domain_profile.DomainProfile`.** The existing
  `DomainProfile` is a *meta-domain* concept (coding / research /
  design) and carries cross-domain machinery (`repo_context_extractor`,
  `intent_classifier`, `vague_terms`, `detector`, `verifiable_predicates`,
  `safe_defaults`). Task classes are *within-meta-domain* shapes
  (cli / webhook / game-2d / ...) and carry only shape-specific data
  (completion mode, default AC, probe-kind hints). The two taxonomies
  are orthogonal; `safe_defaults` remains intentionally on the
  meta-domain layer and is not duplicated here. The earlier #1171
  schema sketch listed `safe_defaults` as a per-class field, but on
  implementation review that field is meta-domain-scoped (e.g.
  "default to pytest" applies to all coding task classes equally) and
  belongs on `DomainProfile`, not on this catalog.
- **`default_ac_template` is `tuple[str, ...]` matching
  `Seed.acceptance_criteria` exactly.** No new AC dataclass is needed
  because the Seed already accepts plain strings.
- **`runtime_probe_kinds` is a `tuple[str, ...]` placeholder.** L3 is
  still pending its minimal-substrate audit; the strings stay
  human-readable for now and become a typed enum when L3 lands.
- **Serialization uses underscored identifiers** (`web_service`,
  `data_pipeline`, `game_2d`, `refactor_in_place`) so `TaskClass.value`
  is a valid Python identifier and a JSON-safe ledger key. Prose docs
  in #1157 / #1171 may render the same names with hyphens; both refer
  to the same class.
