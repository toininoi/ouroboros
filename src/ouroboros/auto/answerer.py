    requirements questions such as "Should the app export PII reports?" or
    "Should users be able to download GDPR exports?".  Those are asking for
    feature-level behavior, not compliance-policy decisions.

    Strategy: pass through when the question
      1. mentions a regulated noun (PII/GDPR/HIPAA/SOX/PCI-DSS),
      2. contains a product-question modal (should/can/will/must/do/does/is/are),

         regime as a toggle, which remains a compliance-policy decision.
      5. uses a product-semantics verb (export, download, display, show, view …).

    Past-participle compliance forms (``stored``, ``encrypted``, ``retained``,
    …) are intentionally NOT in the negative list: in product-behavior questions
    they routinely act as adjectives modifying a regulated noun (``view stored
    PII``, ``display encrypted HIPAA files``), and the sentence's main action is
    the product-semantics verb. Pure-compliance phrasings using past-participle
