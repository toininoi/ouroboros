"""Adapter from firewall audit events to the core event store.

The firewall (`plugin/firewall.py`) emits events that conform to
`schemas/0.1/audit-event.schema.json`. Those events have
`additionalProperties: false`, so any wrapping fields the core ledger
needs (`id`, `aggregate_type`, `aggregate_id`, `timestamp`) MUST live
in a layer ABOVE the audit-event boundary, not inside it.

This adapter:

  - `wrap_plugin_event(event_dict, *, correlation_id, aggregate_id=None)`
    returns a row-shaped envelope ready for `persistence.event_store`.
    The full audit event becomes the `payload`; the envelope adds the
    fields the core ledger requires.

  - `unwrap_plugin_event(envelope) -> dict`
    returns the original audit event from a stored envelope. Used by
    consumers that need to round-trip events back into schema-valid
    form (e.g. `ooo plugin status` reading the audit trail).

  - `make_event_sink(append_fn, *, correlation_id, ...) -> EventSink`
    factory that produces a `firewall.EventSink` callable wired to a
    given append function (signature `append(envelope: dict) -> None`).
    Production wires it to `EventStore.append`; tests can wire it to a
    list.

This module deliberately does NOT import `persistence/event_store.py`
or its async machinery. It speaks the envelope shape, not the store.
The CLI (#731) is the integration point that takes a real EventStore
async session and bridges to `append_fn`.
