"""Plugin artifact digest.

Per the locked RFC (`docs/rfc/userlevel-plugins.md`, "Trust identity"),
trust records and lockfile entries are keyed by the tuple
`(source.type, source_identity, artifact_digest)`. The digest covers the
**complete installed artifact**, not just the manifest, so that a code
substitution under the same source produces a fresh trust subject.

The hashing input is dispatched per source type (see the RFC table). For
`plugin_home` and `local_path` the input is the **canonical tree hash**
of the installed subtree; for `first_party` it is the canonical tree
hash applied to the program's subtree at boot.

The serialization is independent of any tarball dialect (no `ustar` /
`pax` quirks) so arbitrary path lengths and link targets are covered:

  1. Walk the subtree depth-first, collecting one record per regular
     file and per symlink. Directories are implicit; other file types
     (devices, FIFOs, sockets) are rejected at install time.
  2. For each entry, build `<mode>\\0<path>\\0<sha256-of-content-or-link-target>\\0`.
  3. Sort the records lexicographically by `<path>` (NUL = byte 0x00).
  4. The canonical tree hash is `sha256(concat(sorted records))`, hex-prefixed
     with the literal `sha256:`.

The digest is recomputed before every invocation for `plugin_home` and
`local_path`; mismatch with the trusted record fails closed with
`result.status="trust_subject_changed"`.
