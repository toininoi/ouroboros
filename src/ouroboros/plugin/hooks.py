"""Plugin lifecycle hook contract types.

This module is the first reviewable slice of issue #939. It introduces
the typed vocabulary the harness will use to dispatch plugin lifecycle
hooks — without changing runtime behavior, manifest schema validation,
or audit emission yet. The shape mirrors the contract documented in
``docs/rfc/userlevel-plugins.md`` (the boundary doc that landed in
``f718ef89e``).

What this module owns:

* :class:`HookKind` — the v1 hook vocabulary. Only the hooks listed as
  "Included" in the RFC are enumerated; deferred hooks are exposed
  separately via :class:`DeferredHookKind` so we can keep an
  explicit, audit-friendly record of v1 vs future scope without
  silently accepting them at manifest-validation time.
* :class:`HookFailurePolicy` — the v1 failure policies (``fail_open``
  / ``fail_closed``).
* :data:`HOOK_AUDIT_EVENTS` — the audit event names the wrapper emits
  for hook execution outcomes (``plugin.hook.blocked`` /
  ``plugin.hook.failed``).
* :func:`is_v1_hook_kind` / :func:`is_v1_failure_policy` — helpers
  consumed by manifest validators in follow-up PRs. They live here so
  the contract is the single source of truth.

What this module does **not** do:

* Wire hook dispatch into ``HarnessRunner`` or any runtime path.
* Change the manifest schema or the existing :class:`HookSpec`
  dataclass (validators that consume these helpers land in a follow-up
  PR).
* Emit audit events. The event names are exported as constants only.
* Add or remove permissions. Hook-specific permission emission is a
  future extension per the RFC.

Routes to #939. The full lifecycle slate lands incrementally; this
module is intentionally narrow enough to review as a typed contract
before any wiring change.
