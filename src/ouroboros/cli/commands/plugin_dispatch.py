"""Plugin dispatch fallback for the top-level ``ooo`` CLI.

Per the locked RFC (`docs/rfc/userlevel-plugins.md`, "UX / Plugin name →
command-namespace mapping"), every installed plugin's manifest ``name``
field is the user-facing command namespace:

    ooo github-pr-ops review https://github.com/...

When typer's main app does not recognize ``github-pr-ops`` as a
registered subcommand, this module is consulted as a fallback: it
builds a one-shot Click command that resolves the name against the
user's lockfile, looks up the matching ``RegisteredProgram``, and runs
the requested subcommand through ``firewall.invoke_plugin``.

The fallback is deliberately read-only: it never installs, trusts, or
mutates the lockfile. State-mutating actions remain in the
``ooo plugin {add,install,trust,disable,remove}`` command group.

Out of scope here (tracked in #733): bridging the firewall's bounded-
payload audit trail to the user's terminal output. The firewall captures
stdout/stderr to compute the sha256 hash that lands on the audit ledger;
this dispatcher writes the captured bytes back through to the user's
terminal so they see what the plugin produced.

# The manager subcommands (``ooo plugin add|install|trust|disable|remove``)
# accept ``--lockfile`` and ``--trust-root`` so an operator can target a
# non-default install location (alternate user, sandboxed test rig, an
# isolated profile under a project directory). Without a matching surface
# on the runtime dispatcher, those installs are write-only — the manager
# wrote the entry, but ``ooo <plugin>`` cannot find it because dispatch
# was hard-wired to ``DEFAULT_LOCKFILE_PATH`` / ``DEFAULT_TRUST_ROOT``.
# That broke the override surface end-to-end.
#
# Click commands built lazily by the typer fallback do not have a clean
# place to thread CLI flags (the dispatcher is invoked positionally as
# ``ooo <plugin> <command> [args...]``, so adding ``--lockfile`` here
# would collide with the plugin's own argv namespace). Use environment
# variables instead — operators can ``OUROBOROS_PLUGIN_LOCKFILE=...
# ooo <plugin> ...`` to point dispatch at the same paths used during
# install. CI rigs and test fixtures plumb the same env var.
